Here are the actual files that constitute the chrome extension `myfaveTT`.

To install via the Chrome Web Store (recommended): [instructions](https://myfavett.com/)

Or, if you want to install from here:

1. go to [releases](https://github.com/ZYinMD/myfaveTT-dist/releases) and pick a version.
2. download the zip, unzip it.
3. visit `chrome://extensions` in chrome, turn on "Developer mode" on the top right.
4. click "Load unpacked", then choose the folder you just unzipped.

(for most people, there shouldn't be any reason to install this way)
