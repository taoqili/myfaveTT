Here are the actual files that go into the chrome extension **`myfaveTT`**.

## To install via the Chrome Web Store (recommended):

Refer to [myfavett.com](https://myfavett.com/).

## If you want to install from here:

1. go to [releases](https://github.com/ZYinMD/myfaveTT-dist/releases) and pick a version.
2. download the zip, unzip it.
3. visit `chrome://extensions` in chrome, turn on "Developer mode" on the top right.
4. click "Load unpacked", then choose the folder you just unzipped.

(Normally there isn't any reason to install this way - it can't auto-update, and has no other advantage. )
