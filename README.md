Here are the actual files that go into the chrome extension [myfaveTT](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/myfavett/gmajiifkcmjkehmngbopoobeplhoegad).

## To install via the Chrome Web Store (recommended):

See [myfavett.com](https://myfavett.com/).

## If you want to install from here:

1. go to [releases](https://github.com/ZYinMD/myfaveTT-dist/releases) and pick a version, download the zip, unzip it.
3. visit `chrome://extensions` in chrome, turn on "Developer mode" on the top right, then click "Load unpacked".
4. choose the folder you just unzipped.

(Normally there's no reason to install this way - it can't auto-update, and has no other advantages. )
